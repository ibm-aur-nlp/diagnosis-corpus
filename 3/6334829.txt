Systemic uveitis syndromes in childhood: an analysis of 340 cases.

Three hundred forty patients with anterior uveitis associated with a specific systemic disease are described. All patients developed uveitis or the systemic disease, or both, prior to the age of 16 years, By far the most frequent systemic disorder was a sero-negative arthritis. Others included sarcoidosis, Beh√ßet's disease, the Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, and arteritis. Children with pauciarticular juvenile chronic arthritis, especially when associated with antinuclear antibodies, are at particular risk of developing chronic uveitis and they should be screened at frequent intervals, even if asymptomatic. Treatment of secondary cataracts in children using vitreous cutters usually gives good results. The most devastating complication of chronic uveitis is secondary glaucoma.
