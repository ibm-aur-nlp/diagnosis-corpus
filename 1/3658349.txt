Pseudophakic and aphakic retinal detachment mimicking cystoid macular edema.

Seventeen eyes of patients who were being followed by their ophthalmologists for aphakic (8 eyes) or pseudophakic (9 eyes) cystoid macular edema (CME) were examined on referral. All eyes showed retinal detachment (RD), and eight eyes had CME with RD. Most RDs were inferior and shallow. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) was noted in 15 eyes (88.2%). There was history of vitreous loss during the last intraocular surgery in 88.2% eyes. Visual acuity ranged from 20/40 to hand movements. Fundus view was hazy in most eyes, and indirect ophthalmoscopy was most useful in detecting RD. Retinal reattachment with scleral buckling and/or vitrectomy was achieved in 16 eyes (94.1%). Postoperative visual recovery was jeopardized due to longstanding macular detachment of greater than 1 month in 11 eyes (64.7%). Eight eyes (47%) achieved 20/50 vision whereas 25% did not improve to better than 20/400. Factors leading to failure in making the correct diagnosis and their prevention are discussed.
