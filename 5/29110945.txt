The Progression of Geographic Atrophy Secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration.

Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that leads to progressive and irreversible loss of visual function. Geographic atrophy is defined by the presence of sharply demarcated atrophic lesions of the outer retina, resulting from loss of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and underlying choriocapillaris. These lesions typically appear first in the perifoveal macula, initially sparing the foveal center, and over time often expand and coalesce to include the fovea. Although the kinetics of GA progression are highly variable among individual patients, a growing body of evidence suggests that specific characteristics may be important in predicting disease progression and outcomes. This review synthesizes current understanding of GA progression in AMD and the factors known or postulated to be relevant to GA lesion enlargement, including both affected and fellow eye characteristics. In addition, the roles of genetic, environmental, and demographic factors in GA lesion enlargement are discussed. Overall, GA progression rates reported in the literature for total study populations range from 0.53 to 2.6 mm 2
