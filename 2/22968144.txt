Determinants and two-year change in anterior chamber angle width in a Chinese population.

To study the population distribution and longitudinal changes in anterior chamber angle width and its determinants among Chinese adults. Prospective cohort, population-based study. Persons aged 35 years or more residing in Guangzhou, China, who had not previously undergone incisional or laser eye surgery. In December 2008 and December 2010, all subjects underwent automated keratometry, and a random 50% sample had anterior segment optical coherence tomography with measurement of angle-opening distance at 500 μm (AOD500), angle recess area (ARA), iris thickness at 750 μm (IT750), iris curvature, pupil diameter, corneal thickness, anterior chamber width (ACW), lens vault (LV), and lens thickness (LT) and measurement of axial length (AL) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) by partial coherence laser interferometry. Baseline and 2-year change in AOD500 and ARA in the right eye. A total of 745 subjects were present for full biometric testing in both 2008 and 2010 (mean age at baseline, 52.2 years; standard deviation [SD], 11.5 years; 53.7% were female). Test completion rates in 2010 varied from 77.3% (AOD500: 576/745) to 100% (AL). Mean AOD500 decreased from 0.25 mm (SD, 0.13 mm) in 2008 to 0.21 mm (SD, 13 mm) in 2010 (difference, -0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] , -0.05 to -0.03). The ARA decreased from 21.5 ± 3.73 10(-2) mm(2) to 21.0 ± 3.64 10(-2) mm(2) (difference, -0.46; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.41). The decrease in both was most pronounced among younger subjects and those with baseline AOD500 in the widest quartile at baseline. The following baseline variables were significantly associated with a greater 2-year decrease in both AOD500 and ARA: deeper ACD, steeper iris curvature, smaller LV, greater ARA, and greater AOD500. By using simple regression models, we could explain 52% to 58% and 93% of variation in baseline AOD500 and ARA, respectively, but only 27% and 16% of variation in 2-year change in AOD500 and ARA, respectively. Younger persons and those with the least crowded anterior chambers at baseline have the largest 2-year decreases in AOD500 and ARA. The ability to predict change in angle width based on demographic and biometric factors is relatively poor, which may have implications for screening.
