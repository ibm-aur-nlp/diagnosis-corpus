Chronic hematic cyst of the orbit. Role of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis.

Chronic hematic cysts of the orbit are rare causes of proptosis. They progressively enlarge causing expansion or erosion of the orbital bones and may give the appearance on computed tomography (CT) scan of a malignant orbital process. Hematic cysts have a characteristic appearance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is virtually pathognomic. The authors present two cases in which MRI was used to establish the diagnosis.
