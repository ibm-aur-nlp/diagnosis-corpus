Retinotopic mapping of the visual cortex using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a patient with central scotomas from atrophic macular degeneration.

To describe retinotopic mapping of the visual cortex when a central scotoma is present. Single observational case report. Scanning laser ophthalmoscope perimetry was used to define the site and stability of fixation and the area of dense scotoma. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the visual cortex was performed while the patient viewed an expanding annular stimulus. Retinotopic mapping of the visual cortex for a patient with a horseshoe scotoma from geographic atrophy involving the macular region showed a loss of stimulation to the cortical areas representing the site of the atrophic lesion. Cortical retinotopic mapping can be performed successfully in patients with central scotomas from macular disease. This study can serve as a basis for the future investigation of cortical plasticity in visual cortex.
