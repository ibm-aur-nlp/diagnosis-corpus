Heidelberg retina tomography and optical coherence tomography in normal, ocular-hypertensive, and glaucomatous eyes.

To evaluate optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) appearance in normal, ocular-hypertensive, and glaucomatous eyes undergoing confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Prospective, cross-sectional study. Seventy-eight eyes of 78 consecutive normal (n = 17), ocular-hypertensive (n = 23), and glaucomatous subjects (n = 38) were enrolled. Each patient underwent complete ophthalmic examination, achromatic automated perimetry, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg Retinal Tomography [HRT]), and OCT. Topographic HRT parameters (disc area, cup-disc ratio, rim area, rim volume, cup shape measure, mean RNFL thickness, and cross-sectional area) and mean OCT-generated RNFL thickness were evaluated in each group. OCT and HRT assessment of optic disc and RNFL anatomy. OCT RNFL thickness showed no difference between normal and ocular-hypertensive eyes (P = 0.15) but was significantly less in glaucomatous eyes (P  <  0.001). HRT measurements of rim area, cup-disc ratio, cup shape measure, RNFL thickness, and RNFL cross-sectional area were significantly less in glaucomatous eyes (all P  <  0.005) and were correlated with mean OCT RNFL thickness (all P  <  0.02). RNFL thickness using OCT or HRT was highly correlated with visual field mean defect during achromatic perimetry (P  <  0.0001). Both HRT and OCT can differentiate glaucomatous from nonglaucomatous eyes. RNFL thickness measurements using OCT correspond to disc topographic parameters using HRT.
