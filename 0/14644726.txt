Trypan blue staining in vitreoretinal surgery.

To evaluate the efficacy of trypan blue for staining the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and epiretinal membranes (ERM) in vitreoretinal surgery. Prospective noncomparative case series. Fifty eyes of 50 patients with macular pucker (n = 22), macular hole (n = 18), or a combination (n = 2), proliferative vitreoretinopathy (n = 5), or diabetic retinopathy (n = 3). Trypan blue 0.2% was used to stain the ILM or ERM during vitreoretinal surgery. The intraoperative visibility of the membranes was scored as poor, moderate, good, or excellent. The application of trypan blue onto the ILM or the ERM resulted in a useful bluish staining, facilitating the identification, delineation, and removal of the membranes in all surgeries. No residual staining or adverse effects related to the dye were observed. Trypan blue stains both ILM and ERM and might be an useful tool in vitreoretinal surgery.
