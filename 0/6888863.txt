Adenoma of the iris-pigment epithelium.

An 11-year-old boy was noted to have a multinodular tumor involving the peripheral iris and trabecular meshwork in his left eye. During the next 12 years, the lesion slowly enlarged and produced pigmentary dispersion in the anterior chamber and glaucomatous changes in the optic disc. Histopathologic examination of the tumor after its removal by iridocyclectomy revealed features consistent with the diagnosis of adenoma of the iris-pigment epithelium. A correlation between the clinical and histopathologic features is presented. Clinical features that can be helpful in differentiating an adenoma of the iris-pigment epithelium from a malignant melanoma are discussed.
