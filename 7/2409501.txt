Aging macular degeneration. Clinical features of treatable disease.

Argon laser treatment reduces visual loss in patients with aged macular degeneration and extrafoveal subretinal neovascular membranes (SRNVM). Ophthalmologists must now educate patients concerning the symptoms of subretinal neovascularization and give them an Amsler grid. If a patient develops symptoms he should be examined promptly. High quality fluorescein angiograms and meticulous contact lens examinations of the macula should be performed to detect subtle neovascularization. Ophthalmologists must be familiar with the clinical and fluorescein angiographic changes of drusen, retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, and retinal pigment epithelial detachments in order to differentiate them from subretinal neovascular membranes.
