Ophthalmologic assessment of young patients with Alport syndrome.

Alport syndrome is an X-linked disease affecting basement membrane collagen. It is characterized by nephritis associated with high-tone sensorineural hearing impairment and ophthalmic signs. Although ocular changes have been described in adults, few data exist regarding the incidence of abnormal ocular features in adolescence and childhood. Fifteen male and five female patients with Alport syndrome underwent ophthalmologic, audiologic, and nephrologic assessments. All patients studied had hematuria and a positive family history of Alport syndrome. Thirteen patients had a renal biopsy that showed characteristic electron microscopic changes of the disease. Eleven patients had high-tone sensorineural impairment. Electrophysiologic investigations performed included electroretinography, visual-evoked potentials, and electro-oculography. Two patients had early signs of anterior lenticonus, three had flecks in the retina, and two patients also had posterior subcapsular cataracts. None of the patients had significant electrophysiologic abnormalities. These findings indicate that ocular changes are uncommon and subtle in young patients with Alport syndrome, and suggest that the signs increase in frequency and severity with age.
