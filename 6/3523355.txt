Infectious retinitis. Diagnostic modalities.

Advances in surgical techniques have made vitreoretinal and sclerochorio-retinal biopsies part of the available diagnostic armamentarium of the ophthalmologist. Special studies can be performed on tissue obtained in this way in order to provide a specific etiologic diagnosis of virus associated pathology. The advantages and disadvantages of immunopathologic and ultrastructural methods, tissue culture, and nucleic acid hybridization techniques for viral identification are compared and discussed.
