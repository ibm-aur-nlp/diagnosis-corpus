Viewing through the asteroids.

Thirty to seventy percent of patients with asteroid hyalosis will also have diabetes. In this group of patients where view of the fundus is essential, it is often difficult or impossible by conventional ophthalmoscopy. We have noted the excellent visualization of fundus detail in asteroid hyalosis on routine fundus fluorescein angiography. The asteroid bodies are  " optically removed "  from the vitreous with this technique, thus affording a view for diagnosis previously thought impossible without actual vitrectomy. A series of patients, optimal camera filter combination, and a theory for this effect are presented.
