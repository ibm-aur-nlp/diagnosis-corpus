Automated Detection of Hemifield Difference across Horizontal Raphe on Ganglion Cell--Inner Plexiform Layer Thickness Map.

A MATLAB-based (The MathWorks, Inc, Natick, MA) computer program (the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer [GCIPL] hemifield test) for automated detection of GCIPL thickness difference across the horizontal raphe was developed, and its glaucoma diagnostic performance was assessed. Cross-sectional study. A total of 65 eyes of normal, healthy subjects along with 162 eyes of patients with glaucoma (79 preperimetric and 83 early perimetric). Cirrus high-definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT) (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) was used to scan all of the subjects' macular and optic discs. A positive (i.e.,  " outside normal limits " ) GCIPL hemifield test result was declared if the following 3 conditions were all met: (1) The reference line (a horizontal line dividing the superior and inferior hemifields) is continuously detected for longer than one-half of the distance from the temporal inner elliptical annulus to the outer elliptical annulus; (2) the average GCIPL thickness difference within 10 pixels of the reference line, both above and below, is ≥5 μm; and (3) the average RGB color ranges of the 10 pixels above and below the reference line display blue in 1 hemifield and red/yellow/white in the other hemifield. Comparison of diagnostic ability using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). A positive GCIPL hemifield test result was observed more frequently in the glaucomatous eyes (74/79 preperimetric, 78/83 early perimetric) than in the normal eyes (1/65). In the preperimetric group, the AUC of the GCIPL hemifield test (0.967; sensitivity 94.94%, specificity 98.46%) was greater than that of the minimum GCIPL thickness (0.933), the inferotemporal GCIPL thickness (0.907), and the average GCIPL thickness (0.899) (P=0.09, 0.06, and 0.03, respectively). In the early perimetric group, the AUC of the GCIPL hemifield test (0.962; sensitivity 93.98%, specificity 96.46%) was greater than that of the inferotemporal GCIPL thickness (0.938), the minimum GCIPL thickness (0.919), and the average GCIPL thickness (0.912) (P=0.38, 0.17, and 0.11, respectively). For discrimination of early glaucomatous structural loss, most notably in preperimetric glaucoma cases, identification of the GCIPL thickness difference across the horizontal raphe was effective.
